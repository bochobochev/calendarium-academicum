Courses scheduling application

We need an application for storing Students and Teachers information like name, age, group and courses. We have two type of courses -Main and Secondary.
The application should be able to add remove or modify students and teachers. 

With this application we should be able to create different reports :

* how many students we have
* how many teachers we have
* how many courses by type we have
* which students participate in specific course
* which students participate in specific group
* find all teachers and students for specific group and course
* find all students older than specific age and participate in specific course

Please write tests and use an in-memory database.

The application should provide public API.

TODO
* Refactor - use model POJOs in Controllers.
* Security
* UI
